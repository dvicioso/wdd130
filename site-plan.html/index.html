            <h1>Purpose of this site</h1>
            <p>This web page will contain two main blocks of knowledge: 1) spiritual and 
            2) secular. I define spiritual knowledge here not only the one that 
            pertain to a particular faith or religion but also the information that 
            a allow to connect with the human sense of meaning.</p>
            <p>The spiritual knowledge is the foundation block over which the secular is
            built. As the secular knowledge is a mean by which a person can reach 
            specific target, the target should be properly identified through 
            exercising the tools provide by things of the spirit. In other words, 
            the spiritual should be sought first to provide the sense of direction,
            to identify our mission to create in our minds with detail what we want 
            to accomplish with our profession. It is drawing or the map that is 
            elaborated before the construction of a home or building begin.</p>
            <p>On the secular site, the information provided will be in the direction of 
            getting study habits and tools to be successful as student and current occupation. 
            There will be article written by students informing the success of certain practices, 
            what is working well with some people that can be useful for others. Furthermore, 
            learning method that backed by scientific research that can improve the ability 
            of the students to learn and put in practice what is learned will be also portrayed.</p>
            <p>Relevant information regarding institutions education access will be available 
            and how to apply to them.</p>
            <p>Special courses will be published to help students overcome certain deficiencies 
            and make them more productive using their times such as academic writing,
            planning skills, personal finance and how to build resilience.</p>
            <P>For undergraduates that are in the practices of their professions 
            will put forward information about how to be successful on the professional life.
            One characteristic of this information is that it is not normally received school
            curriculums such as how to manage politics on the job place, how to create 
            a professional branding and so on.</P>
            <p>The changes that are happening on the workplace requires that the workers develop
            new skill and flexibility to work for example remotely at home where new challenge
            are arising as there is not now distinction between the work environment and home.
            The site will provide helpful information that help visitor overcome these new 
            difficulties. Part of hardships is how to deal with the stress, anxiety and other
            mental disorders and many professionals are increasing the visits to the doctor 
            as a result. It has been demonstrated that it the required information individual
            can successfully manage this kind of situation as soon as they arrive. The site 
            will put an especial emphasis on providing useful information and techniques 
            that can enhance life quality of the professionals.</p>
            <p>The site will have a planning process on place to ensure that the purpose of
            the site is normally fulfilled by carefully evaluating the impact of the
            information on the different target population through systematic survey 
            prepared to capture the impression of visitors and how they are using the 
            information to achieve their objectives on what they are pursuing at the moment.</p>
