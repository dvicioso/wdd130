      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p class="paragraph1">
      This web page will contain two main blocks of knowledge: 1) spiritual and 2) secular. 
I define spiritual knowledge here not only the one that pertain to a particular faith or 
religion but also the information that a allow to connect with the human sense of meaning.

      </p>
      <p class="paragraph1">
        The spiritual knowledge is the foundation block over which the secular is built. 
        As the secular knowledge is a mean by which a person can reach specific target, 
        the target should be properly identified through exercising the tools provide by things of the spirit.  
        In other words, the spiritual should be sought first to provide the sense of direction, 
        to identify our mission to create in our minds with detail what we want to accomplish with our profession. 
        It is drawing or the map that is elaborated before the construction of a home or building begin.
        <p class="paragraph1">
          On the secular site, the information provided will be in the direction of getting study habits and tools 
          to be successful as student and current occupation. There will be article written by students informing 
          the success of certain practices, what is working well with some people that can be useful for others. 
          Furthermore, learning method that backed by scientific research that can improve the ability of the 
          students to learn and put in practice what is learned will be also portrayed.
          <p class="paragraph1">
          Relevant information regarding institutions education access will be available and how to apply to them.
          <p class="paragraph1">
            From time to time, the visitor will complete self-evaluations to identity potential areas of improvements
             with suggested actions to be completed. 

          </p>
          <p class="paragraph1">
            Special courses will be published to help students overcome certain deficiencies and make them more 
            productive using their times such as academic writing, planning skills, personal finance and how to build 
            resilience.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph1">
            For undergraduates that are in the practices of their professions will put forward information about how to be 
            successful on the professional life. One characteristic of this information is that it is not normally 
            received school curriculums such as how to manage politics on the job place, how to create a professional 
            branding and so on. 
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph1">
          The changes that are happening on the workplace requires that the workers develop new skill and flexibility 
          to work for example remotely at home where new challenge are arising as there is not now distinction 
          between the work environment and home. The site will provide helpful information that help visitor 
          overcome these new difficulties. Part of hardships is how to deal with the stress, anxiety and 
          other mental disorders and many professionals are increasing the visits to the doctor as a result. 
          It has been demonstrated that it the required information individual can successfully manage 
          this kind of situation as soon as they arrive. The site will put an especial emphasis on providing 
          useful information and techniques that can enhance life quality of the professionals.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph1">
        The site will have a planning process on place to ensure that the purpose of the site is normally fulfilled
         by carefully evaluating the impact of the information on the different target population through 
         systematic survey prepared to capture the impression of visitors and how they are using the information
          to achieve their objectives on what they are pursuing at the moment.
