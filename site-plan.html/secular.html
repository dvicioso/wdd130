                <div id = "box1">
                    <p>Personal growth is the act of developing as an individual. The term can be 
                        used to describe personal development in several areas including mental,
                        physical, and emotional health.These areas are often interlinked and the
                        ultimate aim of each personal growth goal will be to enrich all areas of your
                         life.
                        Personal growth will help you become a better individual and benefit your 
                        health and wellbeing in many ways. It’s also useful in many aspects of your 
                        life including your career or business, relationships, and much more.</p>

                    <p>There are two major trends in the world that pose a fundamental challenge – and
                         many opportunities – to our educational system. One is the world is shifting 
                         from an industrial economy to a knowledge economy. The other is the rising 
                         generation – brought up on the Internet – is very differently motivated to learn. 

                        These two forces, argues Dr. Tony Wagner, co-director of Harvard's Change 
                        Leadership Group, compel us to reconceptualize education in this country. 
                        In his thoughtful analysis of future industry needs and education readiness 
                        studies, Dr. Wagner has identified what he calls a "global achievement gap," 
                        which is the leap between what even our best schools are teaching, and the 
                        must-have skills of the future:
                        
                        Critical thinking and problem-solving
                        Collaboration across networks and leading by influence
                        Agility and adaptability
                        Initiative and entrepreneurialism
                        Effective oral and written communication
                        Accessing and analyzing information
                        Curiosity and imagination

                <h2>Professional Skills</h2>
                <div id = "box3">
                    <p>Professional skills are abilities that can help you succeed in your job. 
                        A professional skill describes a habit, personality trait or ability that
                        positively affects your performance in the workplace. Having such skills 
                        can benefit people in nearly all job positions, industries and work environments.
                        Professional skills are also called soft skills, meaning skills easily 
                        transferred from one job to another. Soft skills describe how we relate 
                        to our environment and the people around us. By contrast, hard skills refer 
                        to more technical or specialized knowledge related to a specific 
                        job or industry.</p>

                <h2>Longlife Learning</h2>
                <div id = "box4">
                    <p>Lifelong learning has become the overarching concept and vision for education, 
                    as reflected in the United Nations’ 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 
                    Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), one of which, SDG 4, explicitly petitions 
                    countries to ‘ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong 
                    learning opportunities for all’ (UNESCO, 2016). Lifelong learning (LLL) is rooted 
                    in the integration of learning and living, covering learning activities for people 
                    of all ages, in all life-wide contexts and through a variety of modalities that, 
                    together, meet a range of learning needs and demands.</p>
