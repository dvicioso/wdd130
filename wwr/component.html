        <h2>Steam Cycles</h2>
        <h2>Ranking Cycle</h2>
      
        <p>The Rankine cycle is an idealized thermodynamic cycle describing the process by which certain 
            heat engines, such as steam turbines or reciprocating steam engines, allow mechanical work 
            to be extracted from a fluid as it moves between a heat source and heat sink. 
            The Rankine cycle is named after William John Macquorn Rankine, a Scottish polymath 
            professor at Glasgow University.</p>
        <p>Heat energy is supplied to the system via a boiler where the working fluid (typically water) 
            is converted to a high pressure gaseous state (steam) in order to turn a turbine. After 
            passing over the turbine the fluid is allowed to condense back into a liquid state as waste
             heat energy is rejected before being returned to boiler, completing the cycle. Friction 
             losses throughout the system are often neglected for the purpose of simplifying calculations
              as such losses are usually much less significant than thermodynamic losses, especially in 
              larger systems.</p>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>The Rankine cycle closely describes the process by which steam engines commonly found in thermal 
            power generation plants harness the thermal energy of a fuel or other heat source to generate 
            electricity. Possible heat sources include combustion of fossil fuels such as coal, natural gas, 
            and oil, use of mined resources for nuclear fission, renewable fuels like biomass and ethanol, 
            or energy capture of natural sources such as concentrated solar power and geothermal energy. 
            Common heat sinks include ambient air above or around a facility and bodies of water such as rivers, 
            ponds, and oceans.</p>
        <p>The ability of a Rankine engine to harness energy depends on the relative temperature difference between 
            the heat source and heat sink. The greater the differential, the more mechanical power can be 
            efficiently extracted out of heat energy, as per Carnot's theorem.</p>
        <p>The efficiency of the Rankine cycle is limited by the high heat of vaporization of the working fluid. 
            Unless the pressure and temperature reach super critical levels in the boiler, 
            the temperature range that the cycle can operate over is quite small: 
            Steam turbine entry temperatures are typically around 565 °C and condenser temperatures 
            are around 30 °C.[citation needed] This gives a theoretical maximum Carnot efficiency for
             the turbine alone of about 63.8% compared with an actual overall thermal efficiency of less 
             than 50% for typical power stations. This low steam turbine entry temperature 
             (compared to a gas turbine) is why the Rankine (steam) cycle is often used as a bottoming 
         cycle to recover otherwise rejected heat in combined-cycle gas turbine power stations.</p>
