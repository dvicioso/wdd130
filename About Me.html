    <h2> Dustral Vicioso </h2>
        <p>My name is Dustral Vicioso and I'm currently pursuing a major on Professional Studies at BYU -Idaho. I love to practice tennis, go the gym, read, listening to music and the movie theater. I normally spend most of my free time reading because I want to learn and keep my mind busy.  I'm married with 3 children- two boys and daughter.</p>
        <p> I am mechanical- electrical engineer and work for the mining industry but focusing my role on energy management which has been a work passion for many years. I enrolled on BYU because I was curious about the Pathway Program and the news careers offered.  Furthermore, learning new skill make more competitive and at the same time help to sharp the saw and expand my brain</p>
        <p>I think taking web design course provide me with a basic skill for the modern word, because the possibility of reaching a broad audience through a web page is unlimited. There is some magic around creating your own content online and I excited about it.</p>
        <p>I have been member of the Church of Jesus Christ for around 30 years; I think the gospel is part of my identity and I use it as tool to help be happy despite the life challenges.</p>
